# Dual-DC-Motor-Control-for-Tilt-rotor-Mechanism
Design and Implement a PID controller for controlling the position of two DC motors coupled to a Tilt-rotor Mechanism of a Quadcopter.

The controller requriments are:
1. The actuation speed of the mechanism should be lessthan 2 seconds (end to end actuation).
2. Robust and less subjected to noise and disturbance.
3. The  postion of both motors should match.
